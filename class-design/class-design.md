# Class Design

Principles are guidelines, or “things one should do”.

* For creating classes, some general guidelines to follow are
  * choose descriptive names
  * keep the number of variables low
  * use few control structures

### Prepare for Change

* reason to make as few and as little changes as possible to existing code
  * the risk of one of those changes breaking the entire system.
  * burden in modifying the existing unit tests for the class\\
